# Features & Implementation

## Event Creation / Update
 
Eventise allows a user to create new events, which can either be a conventional event or an online event without a physical location. In order to maximize a userâ€™s flexibility in revenue management and marketing strategy, Eventise allows the user to create different categories of tickets for the same event, each with a specific quantity and price.

### Event Details
* Allow users to upload image from local machine
* Allow rich text editing for event's description

### Multiple Ticket Option
* Allow adding/removing ticket options

### Code: `transaction`
Since the form holds all information (event, ticket, category) which has its own table in the database and model in the backend, a `transaction` block is used to ensure that entries will only be created when they are all validated. Otherwise, a rollback will be triggered.

```javascript
Event.transaction do
   @event.save!
   @event.tickets = tickets_params.to_h.values.map do |ticket|
      ticket = Ticket.new(ticket)
   ...
```
The implementation of _nested attributes_

```javascript
   params.require(:event).permit(
      tickets_attributes: [:id, :name, :price, :quantity, :event_id, :_destroy]
   ...
```

## Ticket Registration

On event's detail show page, there is button linked to a pop-up ticket purchasing process, which displays a list of tickets and their remaining quantity. It also involves checks on the total price and quantity. A checkout summary and order confirmation will be displayed / redirected when action is triggered.

## User Authentication

When user click login from navigation bar, a modal containing the signup/login form pops up. It is a togglable form which keeps track of user's input when on a different form.
